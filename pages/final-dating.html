            <p>He <b>posts on your Facebook,</b><br>
            IMs you when you're bored,<br>
            and <b>flirtexts with you at<br>
            parties.</b> You get that jolt of<br>
            excitement every time he<br>
            writes, and you're dreaming<br>
            of something bigger than<br>
            just endless banter.</p>

            <p>The guy you like <b>has a<br>
            girlfriend,</b> but you feel<br>
            this incredible closeness<br>
            because <b>he confides in<br>
            you</b> and asks your advice<br>
            about his relationship. You<br>
            You can't help thinking that if<br>
            they break up, you're next.</p>

        <section><h2>The Hot Friend</h2>
            <p>You and your best guy<br>
            friend spend <b>tons of time<br>
            together</b> and share stuff<br>
            about your lives that no<br>
            one else knows. You've<br>
            <b>developed real feelings</b><br>

            of ruining your friendship.</p>

            <p>You and your BF <b>broke up</b><br>

            <b>can't stop thinking about</b><br>
            cuddinling in front of the TV<br>
            or htose marathon 3 a.m.<br>
            phone conversations.<br>
            You're stuck on the idea of<br>

            <h3>Go for it!</h3>
            <p>Next time you're IMing<br>
            about a party or a game<br>
            you're both going to, add<br>
            <b>"I'll look for you there,"</b><br>
            then do it- it shows that <br>
            you want to spend time<br>
            together <i>in person.</i><b> Then<br>
            it's up to him</b> to suggest<br>
            another hangout. If he<br>
            doesn't, it's okay to keep<br>
            him in your phone for<br>
            back up flirting, but don't<br>
            let it stop you from<br>
            finding new guys (who<br>
            <i>more</i> than a virtual<br>
            relationship!).</p>

            <h3>Let it go.</h3>
               <p>You might think every<br>
               emotional confession<br>
               puts you one step closer<br>
               to him but <b>he doesn't see<br>
               is that way.</b>He just needs<br>
               someone to be a<br>
               sounding board for his<br>
               relationship problems.<br>
               (though he probabluy likes<br>
               knowing that he has you<br>
               on the back burner.) Use<br>
               your time to have those<br>
               deep coversations with<br>
               guys who are actually<br>
               available- and will make<br>
               you their <b>number one girl.</b></p>

            <h3>Go for it!</h3>
            <p>If your friendship is rock<br>
            solid, it can survive a<br>
            <b>major confession.</b> Tell<br>
            him, "I've been getting<br>
            the vibe that you want to<br>
            be more than just friends,<br>
            so I've been thinking<br>
            about it too." Then <b>wait<br>
            for him to respond.</b> If he's<br>
            not into it, say "You're<br>
            right- friends is better!" It<br>
            will sting, but pretend like<br>
            it never happened and in<br>
            a few weeks, it will all be<br>
            back to normal. And if he<br>
            <i>is</i> into it? OMG, the best!</p>

            <!-- The Ex advice -->
            <h3>Let it go.</h3>
            <p>It's a waste of <b>good love<br>
            energy</b> to cling to a guy<br>
            who has moved on. So<br>
            stop driving past his<br>
            house on the way to<br>
            school or passing him in<br>
            the hallway- even if it<br>
            means going the long<br>
            way- so you <b>don't have<br>
            daily reminders of him.</b><br>
            Hide him on Facebook, so<br>
            he doesn't pop up in your<br>
            news feed. It won't<br>
            happen overnight, but<br>
            you <i>will</i> be able to give<br>
            him up for good.</p>

        <p><i></i>"I liked this guy for<br>
        years and I definitely<br>
        thought he liked me,<br>
        but nothing ever happened. One day I decided<br>
        I couldn't wait forever, so i called him and<br>
        asked, "Hey, do you wanna hang out on<br>
        Friday?" I was so anxious! But he said yes!<br>
        Now we've been together for a year, and he<br> 
        always says how glad he is that i took the first <br>
        step because he had been too nervous."</i><br>

        and so cute, but he<br>
        never really lookeed at<br>
        me. At school i tried to get his attention, but it<br>
        finally hit me that he didn't know I existed. I<br>
        made the decision to hang out with friends<br>
        more and talk to other guys. Soon<br>
        I began wondering what exactly I knew about<br> 
        my crush, and what had even made me like<br>
        him. i realized I didn't really know him at all.</i><br>
